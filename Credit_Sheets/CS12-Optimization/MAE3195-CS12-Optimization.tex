For this homework, you will design an optimum box. The design parameters of the box are shown in the figure below. All of the box's walls have uniform thickness, $t = 5$ mm. The box is to fit on a 18 inch deep shelf that is only 8 feet long. The distance in between shelves is only 18 inches. The box is made of PVC, and the specific cost (cost per unit mass) of this material is $C$~= ~\$0.25 per kg. Find the dimensions of the least expensive box that has at least 0.1~m$^3$ of storage space.
